## Rocket.html

The stars effect was inspired by [WheresDara's CodePen](https://codepen.io/wheresdara/pen/wvXBpwa). I used the css code and adjusted it accordingly.
## Rocket Design

The rocket design is based on a public domain rocket from [Public Domain Vectors](https://publicdomainvectors.org/en/free-clipart/Colorful-missle-vector-image/74243.html).

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- SVG (for the rocket design)
- PNG (logos)
